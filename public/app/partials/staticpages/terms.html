The amount due shall be paid in accordance with clause B.6.4 to the&nbsp;seller's designated bank account with a bank located in the India shown as supported by our standard functionality (which may be modified or discontinued by us at any time without notice) ("Seller's Bank Account") on a Business Day when the automated clearing houses are open for business (Monday through Friday, excluding bank holidays in India). On occasion, payment may be by paper cheque sent to the seller's postal address, for instance, if the seller's bank will not accept&nbsp; an electronic transfer to the Seller's Bank Account.</span></p>
        <p><span><b>6.3</b>&nbsp;A payment made by a buyer in respect of a particular item will not be due or payable to a seller (or if paid, shall be reimbursed by the seller to us), and we will not be liable to the seller if:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>(a) we, in our sole and absolute discretion,  (ii) determine that the seller cannot promptly deliver the item&nbsp; under clause A.5.1 or the seller has otherwise breached the provisions of this&nbsp; User Agreement and we initiate a refund to the buyer, (iii) do not permit&nbsp; a transaction or disbursement to proceed where any limit established by us for&nbsp; a security reason would be exceeded, or (iv) permit a buyer to withdraw from a&nbsp; transaction because the Service is unavailable following the commencement of a&nbsp; transaction</span><span>;</span></p>
        <p><span>(b) we discover the payment is erroneous or relates&nbsp; to a duplicate transaction,&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>(c) the payment is the subject of a chargeback from&nbsp; the buyer's credit card issuer or bank.</span></p>
        <p><span>Where reimbursement by the seller is required under this clause 6, without notice to the seller we may obtain such reimbursement by (i) deducting the amount from the seller's Reserve in clause B.6.4 or any future payments that would otherwise have been owed to the seller, (ii) reversing any transfer to the Seller's Bank Account, (iii) charging the seller's credit card,&nbsp;or (iv) seeking such reimbursement from the seller by any other lawful means.</span></p>
        <p><span>In the event that we elect not to recover from the&nbsp; seller a buyer's chargeback, failed payment, or other payment reversal (a&nbsp; "Payment Failure"), we will assume the debt associated with the&nbsp; Payment Failure and the seller irrevocably assigns to Evezown all rights, title&nbsp; and interest that the seller has in and associated with that debt.</span></p>
        <p><span><b>6.4</b> In order to secure the seller's performance of the potential refund and reimbursement obligations under clause B.6, the seller agrees to maintain at all times a pending payment amount equal to the sum of the immediately preceding 14 days of sales activity and any pending deductions under clause B.6 (a "Reserve"). Evezown may require a higher Reserve, or allow a lower Reserve, as it may determine in its sole and absolute discretion having regard to the rate of chargebacks, refunds, adjustments or other indicators of performance problems related to the seller's use of the Service, or as may be imposed by any payments processor. In order to help maintain the Reserve, payments may be made to the Seller's Bank Account on a rolling 14-day cycle ("Payment Date"), based on the original date of the seller's registration, or on the next Business Day if the scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-Business Day. If the seller requests a change to the scheduled Payment Date, the 14-day cycle will be reset to the requested Payment Date. When the seller initially provides or later changes his or her Seller's Bank Account information, the seller must wait 14 days to request a transfer to that Seller's Bank Account within the 14-day cycle. Subject to the foregoing, after an initial 14 days of sales activity, the seller may request transfers to the Seller's Bank Account at any time within the 14-day cycle.</span></p>
        <p><span><b>6.5</b>&nbsp;We will not bear the risk of credit card fraud (i.e. fraudulent purchase arising from the theft and unauthorized use of a third party's credit card information) occurring in connection with a buyer's authorized credit card payment, and Seller will bear all other risk of fraud or loss; provided, that we will not bear the risk of credit card fraud in connection with any of Seller's products (except those products, if any, that are fulfilled using the Fulfilment by Evezown service) that are not fulfilled strictly in accordance with the order information and shipping information that we provide you.</span></p>
        <p><span><b>7.</b>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of clause B.6.4,&nbsp; if we reasonably conclude, based on information available to us, that seller's&nbsp; actions and/or performance in connection with the Service may result in disputes, chargebacks or other claims, then we may&nbsp; in our sole and absolute discretion delay initiating any remittances and&nbsp; withhold any payments to be made or that are otherwise due to seller in&nbsp; connection with the Service or this Agreement for the shorter of: (a) a period&nbsp; of 90 days following the initial date of suspension; or&nbsp; (b) completion of&nbsp; any investigation(s) regarding any seller actions and/or performance in&nbsp; connection with this Agreement.</span></p>
